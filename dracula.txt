Dracula is a fictional character created by Irish author Bram Stoker in his 1897 Gothic horror novel, "Dracula." The character has since become one of the most iconic figures in horror literature and popular culture.

Count Dracula is depicted as a centuries-old vampire, originally from Transylvania, who possesses supernatural powers such as superhuman strength, the ability to transform into a bat or mist, and the power to control animals. He is portrayed as a charismatic and aristocratic figure who preys upon innocent victims to sustain his own existence by drinking their blood.

The novel "Dracula" follows the story of Count Dracula's attempt to move from Transylvania to England in order to spread the undead curse and find new victims. The narrative is presented through a series of journal entries, letters, and newspaper clippings, providing a sense of immediacy and realism to the story.

The character of Dracula has been adapted countless times in various forms of media, including films, television shows, stage plays, and video games. Some of the most famous adaptations include the classic 1931 film "Dracula," starring Bela Lugosi, as well as more recent interpretations such as Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 film "Bram Stoker's Dracula" and the television series "Dracula" (2013).

Dracula's enduring popularity is due in part to his status as a complex and enigmatic character who embodies themes of seduction, fear, and the struggle between good and evil. He has become a cultural icon, synonymous with the vampire archetype, and continues to fascinate audiences around the world.
